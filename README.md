# AI Driven Network Forecaster

### The AI-Driven Network Forecaster leverages advanced time series analysis and machine learning algorithms to predict network behavior, helping network administrators make informed decisions about capacity planning, traffic routing, and resource allocation.

## Features

* Real-time Traffic Prediction: Forecast network traffic patterns with high accuracy
* Bandwidth Utilization Forecasting: Predict future bandwidth requirements
* Anomaly Detection: Identify unusual network behavior and potential issues
* Multi-timeframe Predictions: Support for short-term (minutes/hours) and long-term (days/weeks) forecasting
* Interactive Dashboard: Real-time visualization of network metrics and predictions
* Alert System: Automated notifications for predicted network issues
* Historical Analysis: Deep dive into past network performance patterns
* Multi-node Support: Monitor and predict across multiple network nodes

## Architecture
